similarity.pkl is a serialized binary file generated using Pythonâ€™s pickle module. It stores the cosine similarity matrix of movies used in the Movie Recommendation System.This file is a core part of the recommendation logic. It allows the system to quickly fetch and compare movie similarities without recalculating the entire matrix every time a user selects a movie.
